Submit the R markdown file and resulting pdf file via D2L Dropbox.   \n\n## Exercise \n\nThis exercise is based on the data and experimental design from exercises 8.42 & 8.43 in the Ott textbook.\n\nA small corporation makes insulation shields for electrical wires using three different types of machines. The corporation wants to evaluate the variation in the inside diameter dimension of the shields produced by the machines. A quality engineer at the corporation randomly selects shields produced by each of the machines and records the inside diameters of each shield (in millimeters). The goal is to determine whether the location parameters (i.e. mean or median) of the three machines differ. \n\nLoad the data set shields.rda.\n\n### Part 1\n\nConstruct side-by-side boxplots for the inside diameters of the insulation shields for the three machines.\n\n### Answer 1\n\n```{r}\n# Insert your R code here.\n\n```\n\n### Part 2\n\nComment on what you see in the boxplots.  How do the medians compare visually?  Do the samples look loke they have roughly the same variability?  Is there severe skewness or outliers in any of the samples?  Be specific.\n\n### Answer 2\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 3  \n\nConduct an analysis of variance test (the standard one that assumes normality and equal variance).  (i) State the null and alternative hypotheses, (ii) use R to compute the test statistic and p-value, and (iii) write a conclusion in context at $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\n### Answer 3\n\n(i)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n(ii)\n```{r}\n# Insert your R code here.\n\n```\n\n(iii)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 4\n\nWhich data conditions for ANOVA are not met, if any?  Provide reasoning for your answer.\n\n### Answer 4\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 5 \n\nConduct an analysis of variance test with the Welch correction.  (i) State the null and alternative hypotheses, (ii) use R to compute the test statistic and p-value, and (iii) write a conclusion in context at $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\n### Answer 5\n\n(i)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n(ii)\n```{r}\n# Insert your R code here.\n\n```\n\n(iii)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 6\n\nWhich data conditions for Welch ANOVA are not met, if any?  Provide reasoning for your answer.\n\n### Answer 6\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 7\n    \nConduct a Kruskal-Wallis test.  (i) State the null and alternative hypotheses, (ii) use R to compute the test statistic and p-value, and (iii) write a conclusion in context using $\\alpha=0.05$.\n    \n### Answer 7\n\n(i)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n(ii)\n```{r}\n# Insert your R code here.\n\n```\n\n(iii)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 8\n\nWhich data conditions for the Kruskal-Wallis test are not met, if any?  Provide reasoning for your answer.\n\n### Answer 8\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 9 \n\nConduct a bootstrapped ANOVA test.  (i) State the null and alternative hypotheses, (ii) use R to compute the test statistic and p-value, and (iii) write a conclusion in context $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\n### Answer 9\n\n(i)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n(ii)\n```{r}\n# Insert your R code here.\n\n```\n\n(iii)\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 10\n\nWhich data conditions for bootstrapped ANOVA are not met, if any?  Provide reasoning for your answer.\n\n### Answer 10\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 11 \n\nDo any of the four statistical inference procedures used here provide a clear answer to the question of whether or not the three machines produce the same average inside diameter for the insulation shields?\n\n### Answer 11\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 12 \n\nIf you were responsible for conducting the statistical analysis here, what would you report to the engineer?\n\n### Answer 12\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n### Part 13  \n\nWhat impact do you think samples of sizes 5, 5, and 10 play here?\n\n### Answer 13\n\nReplace this text with your answer here.\n\n\n\n",
